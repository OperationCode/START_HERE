# Welcome!

Welcome to [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode) and thank you for your interest in contributing. Everything Operation Code does is open source. We love to receive contributions from our community ‚Äî you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the website itself.

We've got quite a few repos, and we understand that can be overwhelming, so you can use this list to learn what the main applications are, and what languages they use.

In addition to any of these projects, you can join our Slack channel \#oc-projects to learn how to contribute.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone! There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that we have today were added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? Be sure to check the project's contributing guide, and you can learn about general guidelines for open source contributions from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

Once you've joined Operation Code as a member, after your first PR (pull request) contribution is accepted, please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/dxbEmwMuGRrJudeK2) to get your sticker!

# Open Source Maintenance Policy

# Operation Code Repositories

Assuming you're ready and excited to work on Open Source Software with Operation Code, you'll want to choose the project that aligns with your interests most. From there, please be sure to read any and all documentation within the respective repository, including - but not limited to - `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`. Please understand our documentation is kept up-to-date, so we hope you read it all before coming to our all-volunteer staff with questions.
