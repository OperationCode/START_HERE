# Operation Code Slack Community Guidelines

*Operation Code is a community platform with transitioning servicemembers, military veterans, military families, and civilian allies. Our goal is creating and fostering collaborations, participate in conversations surrounding the tech industry, ask for help or provide constructive and respectful feedback, and assist one another. More specific guidance can be found in our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/code_of_conduct.md) for reference.*

**INTRODUCE YOURSELF**
* Upon arrival in the Operation Code community Slack, please provide a short description of who you are, what you are looking to achieve while you're here, and how we can help you in the #general channel. 
* Please keep high level announcements to a minimum on #general and thread whenever possible as notifications in this channel will notify the entire community. 

**BE AUTHENTIC**
* Please place your real name in your profile separate from your username and any relevant links to your GitHub, Twitter or LinkedIn if you wish. We encourage you to be transparent as this will create honest and meaningful connections and dialogue.

**CREATE DISCUSSION**
* Respectful and positive engagement and participation creates and fosters individual and community growth.
* Feel free to respond to your POC from the Outreach Team, who will help you connect with others and provide additional guidance or resources.
* We have a #random channel for casual discussions. Please join the channel #mental-health for peer to peer support and 24/7 resources posted on the channel details.

**SELF-PROMOTION**
* We value your individual journey and the projects you’re working on. Sharing your projects allows the community to assist you.
* Submit requests for advice on #career-advice. For project promotion, you can post to #brags or #random.
* The community generally frowns on unsolicited advertising. In general, our guidelines are that you:
1. Ask permission of the channel before posting the solicitation or information
2. State clear intent for the purpose
3. Listen for the response of your peers in channel and act accordingly
* There are specific channels, such as #job-board and #coding-schools, where advertising and recruiting is acceptable.
* Some geographically-focused channels have a higher tolerance for specific kinds of commercial activity focused on events based in that region. Again, read the room.
* Commercial requests via direct messages (“DM”) without prior and/or obvious consent from the receiver are prohibited.
* Please contact moderators@operationcode.org if you have more specific questions.

**ACT PROFESSIONALLY**
* Operation Code is a community of professionals. Before you post, please consider the content and model respectful behavior to others.
* As with any large group of people, disagreements will happen. We understand that you’ll have some strong opinions, but we still expect courtesy during a debate and expect you to refrain from personal attacks.
* If we see members acting unprofessionally, our moderators reserve the right to remove them from the community.
* We have a no-monetary donation policy at Operation Code. If you are seeking help, please request referrals through staff@operationcode.org and refrain from asking mentors of volunteer staff for money.
* If we see members acting unprofessionally, moderators may take action regarding their ability to participate in the community.
* If you are a recruiter, please be mindful about not soliciting or spamming members. You may post your positions on #job-board.
* For code schools, please post all solicitations *ONLY* on #coding-schools, per our Code of Conduct.

**RULE VIOLATIONS**
* Being a part of the Operation Code community is a privilege - not a right. Failure to adhere to the community guidelines can result in your messages being removed (either automatically by our bot, or at an administrator’s discretion).
* All users are expected to follow our Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/code_of_conduct.md). Repeated violations will result in limited access to the community.

## For volunteers
*Volunteers are an integral part of our day to day operations and support for Operation Code! Your involvement and interactions set you apart as leaders and representatives of our community. We greatly appreciate your volunteering with us, and we understand that your personal and professional lives take priority over volunteer work.*

* When contributing as a mentor, we do expect you to behave in a professional manner with personal integrity in your interactions with community members.
* For volunteers, iff you need to take time away from your role, we encourage you to do so and to communicate with OC Leads or Executive Board members on your absence so we can provide back-up staffing in your absence.
* Our team respects that you may need to take care of other obligations in your life, and you may need to step away from OC to handle other things! Please note that if you are out of contact for 60 days, we will need to assume you do not wish to continue your volunteer service. For security, any volunteer-related privileges (email, elevated access, etc.) will be suspended until you connect back with us again at moderators@operationcode.org.
* If you encounter any roadblocks, issues, or have ideas on how to improve our community, please feel free to contact any of our team, at staff@operationcode.org.
