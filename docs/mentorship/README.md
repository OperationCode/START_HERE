# Mission Statement

The Operation Code mentorship program serves to guide our community of service members and their families in their journey of learning to build software and starting a successful career in the tech industry.

# Programs
Our main mentorship platform revolves around [Mentor Service Requests](#mentor-service-requests).  Mentors also provide ongoing informal/ad-hoc assistance by participating in discussions on our Slack Organization and the [Operation Code Community](https://community.operationcode.org/) Discourse forum.

# Mentor Service Requests (1 on 1)
Members can visit [http://op.co.de/mentor-request](http://op.co.de/mentor-request) to request a mentorship session.  Sessions are ~30 minute discussions between a mentee &  mentor via Slack, Voice Chat, or Video Chat.  A session should focus on a mentor helping a mentee with a specific task. Services offered are:

- General guidance (any topic)
- Pair programming
- Code review
- Mock interviews
- Resume review

Mentors can fill out [http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment](http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment) to volunteer as a mentor.

Mentors will watch [http://op.co.de/mentor-requests](http://op.co.de/mentor-requests) for mentee requests.  Any mentor can self-assign to an outstanding mentorship request on a first-come, first serve basis.   Mentors should mark the Airtable spreadsheet with their name as the  Mentor Assigned, add notes, and mark the request as ‘Fulfilled’ after the session takes place (or after a reasonable number of communication attempts).

Operation Code’s Mentorship Coordination team will help pair mentees/mentors and notify other mentors via Slack to fulfill outstanding requests.

After a mentorship session is fulfilled, mentees and mentors are free to continue the learning process on their own.  Mentees are also free to request a new mentorship session from another mentor or on a new topic.
