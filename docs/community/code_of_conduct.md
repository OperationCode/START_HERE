# Operation Code: Code of Conduct

Operation Code is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We do not merely want a community that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive.

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

## Our standards

It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven't even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

* Practice empathy and humility.
* Assume competence first.
* Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the community.
* Listen carefully and actively.
* Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners' context.
* Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
* Treat other people's identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their chosen pronouns.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

## Unacceptable behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we've listed below actions that are counter to our values.  We've also included steps to take if you encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy.

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
> Keep in mind that this is a forum with the goal of first and foremost providing help to people trying to enter the software development industry. While we encourage socializing, *open discussion on any subject is not the goal.* As such consider avoiding potentially controversial subjects like politics or religion. Be aware that you might be asked to stop conversations on these topics.
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions.
* Mocking someone's real or perceived accent or first language.
* Repeatedly interrupting or talking over other people in meetings and discussions.
* Negative or offensive remarks based on gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, or body size.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Staff is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Our staff has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within online spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of Operation Code may be
further defined and clarified by staff.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at <staff@operationcode.org>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Volunteers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the staff.

In most situations (with the exception of severe violations of the Code of Conduct, which is explained below), the process of enforcement is as follows:

* Warning - a staff member or moderator will warn someone that their behavior violates our Code of Conduct and ask them to stop the behavior.
* Temporary Ban - if they continue the behavior after a warning, a staff or moderator will temporarily move the person who is violating the Code of Conduct to a private "timeout" channel separate from other channels, where they will be unable to interact with other channels. The length of this timeout is 24 hours by default, but that can be altered (shorter or longer) at the discretion of Operation Code staff and volunteers.
* Permanent Ban - if someone continues violating the Code of Conduct after their Temporary Ban is complete (or in the private "timeout" channel during their Temporary Ban) staff or moderators will permanently ban that person by deactivating their Slack account.

In the cases of severe violations of the Code of Conduct (including but not limited to sexual harassment or publicly posting someone's private information) staff and moderators will immediately proceed to a Temporary Ban and consult with other staff on whether an immediate Permanent Ban is appropriate. If a majority of staff feel an immediate Permanent Ban is warranted, the person's Slack account will immediately be deactivated.

This process applies to all Operation Code members, staff, partners, community, and anyone else who interacts with the Operation Code organization.

### Creating Additional Accounts ("Sockpuppeting")

Attempting to get around a temporary or permanent ban by creating a new account in the Operation Code Slack will result in an immediate permanent ban.
