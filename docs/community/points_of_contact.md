# Points of Contact

If you have questions about anything at Operation Code, here's who to contact!

### Website / Tech (Open Source)

Join the #oc-projects and #site-feedback channel and contribute to the discussion. Be sure if you’re recommending a change, research and determine if your suggestions has not already been filed in our GitHub. For technical questions or issues, tag @kylemh (front-end), @harry (back-end), or @ohaiwalt (infra) in those channels. For feature requests and other questions, contact the PM, @dmarchante.

### Community (Mentoring, Chapter Leaders, Scholarships)
Start by telling us a bit more about yourself on our [sign up form](http://op.co.de/volunteer). If you want to start an Operation Code chapter in your area to help veterans/ spouses in your community get coding, ping @Ashley in the #general channel and request to be added to our `Chapter-Leaders` channel.

### People Operations (Volunteering)

We are growing fast. Two years ago we were all-volunteers and since then we are ripping at the seams. Today, our Chief Development & Communications Officer (aka Chief of Stuff) is a nominally paid employee, and 2 contracted staff are supporting operations and finance. We promote from within, and are always looking for more good people to add to our roster, and of course more volunteers. Interested in what we’re doing? Ping @Kelly in #general to learn more about joining the staff!

### Partnerships / Business Development / Marketing / Everything Else

If you want to help us with getting the word out and supporting our ongoing operations, we’d love to hear from you! Feel free to ping @Jenn in #general to get in touch.

### Twitterman :sunglasses:

If you just want to shoot the breeze about robots, @hollomancer is your guy.
