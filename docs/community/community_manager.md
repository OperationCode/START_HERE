## Chapter Development

### Chapter Founding
* Once you’ve figured out what works for a smaller network you may be ready to expand into additional cities or markets. Here are a few things to think about before laying down roots:
* Have you secured a strong chapter leader on the ground? 
* Is this market saturated with chapters of similar topics?
* How far are members usually willing to travel (urban vs. rural)?
* What are the demographics of the community?
* Is there a receptive local audience?
* Does this market have the right venues for your events?
* What is your community budget over the next quarter?

### Chapter Leader Support
Local leaders are the pillars of a successful community, and we know that organizing chapters is both an art and a science. Here are some tips for how you can support them:
* Curate Organizer Kits: Providing organizers with the resources to manage a  chapter is an excellent way to encourage consistency across your Meetup Pro network. These organizer kits may include: branded supplies, resources or handbooks to help them understand your guidelines and hit the ground running. 
* Share Best Practices: Bringing together organizers in real life via video conference, instant messaging or on an email thread is a great way for your rockstar organizers to share tips / tricks across your Meetup Pro network. Additionally, many Community Managers use Meetup Pro’s Central Communication to share relevant industry news, communicate organization-wide updates, or provide successful event ideas for organizers.
* Acknowledge How Awesome Your Organizers Are: Sending organizers swag, organizing competitions or spotlighting organizers who are taking interesting approaches are great ways to reward them for their hard work. 
* Provide Financial Support: Hosting chapters can result in expenses for items like supplies, speaker fees, rental on a space, or refreshments. Providing a small stipend for expenses related to Meetup events or as compensation for the leadership team for their time is always appreciated by organizers. Another strategy is to approach a local business as they may be happy to offer their support as sponsors of relevant chapter as they are always looking for ways to get the word out about their products and/or services, and sponsoring a chapter is a great way to do that

### Chapter Engagement
* Connect with Local Leaders: Local leaders function as excellent support as they understand the landscape of the local scene and personalities. Having local leaders allows Community Managers to step in and step out of management. Organizers typically benefit from an online community from a member acquisition perspective however these relationships are further cultivated by real life interactions. Empowering local leaders to moderate, schedule events and keep conversations going help these local communities thrive. A great way to target potential organizers is to create a list of active members that frequently attend your events.
* Centralize Your Audience: Your fans are everywhere, from various forms of social media to grassroots communities. One of the challenges of building a successful community is connecting those fans in one place and being able to manage their engagement. A potential strategy could be to choose one platform, whether it be one that specializes in events, communications, or community as this helps organizations maintain brand integrity and leverage community members in a centralized fashion. By consolidating onto one platform, organizers are able to send one announcement or event posting and provide a consistent look and feel across their community. 
* SEO Optimization: Ensuring your Meetup network has interesting and useful information improves your search rankings on the Meetup site and search engines like Google. Search algorithms base their results on things they think will be be the best and most useful match to someone searching for any given topic. In general, the more specific information you provide, the better off you are. Once you’ve chosen a platform make sure to post a link to the chosen platform from your website or get other partners to post a link to your site from theirs. This is an important step as search engines decide whether any particular site is useful is by checking to see if other sites on the internet are linking to it.

* Crunch the Numbers: Let’s face it, growing a community isn’t free and requires resources. Community Managers have a lot on their plates and may get deep in the trenches of everyday community nurturing. It’s important to keep in mind that the numbers matter to upper management so they can understand both the costs and benefits of the community you are building. Focusing on data to track both chapter and member engagement/growth is an important tool in measuring success.
* Make Your Events Fun: Many organizers choose to make their first Meetup a social Meetup rather than a talk, presentation, or lesson. Are your Meetups usually lectures? Try having one Meetup that’s just an opportunity for members to socialize around their shared interest! Mixing it up a bit helps keep everyone engaged.
