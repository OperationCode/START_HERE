## Procedure for Requesting a Conference Scholarship

### Where can I find conference scholarships?

Conference scholarships will be posted as they are received to the Slack daily announcer in #general at least 3 weeks prior to the conference, except under extenuating circumstances. Users will then be asked to fill out a form which will be linked in the annoucer post if they would like to apply for the scholarship.

### How are conference scholarship recipients selected?

Recipients will be chosen on a merit basis, by the mentors involved in the Operation Code Mentorship Program. Mentors will be given a week to discuss and vote on candidtates.

Criteria for conference scholarships are the following: 
* Willing to provide 2-3 sentences about your contributions to Operation Code;
* Willing to provide a biography or resume to Operation Code;
* A transitioning military, guard & reserve troop, veteran and/ or military family; 
* Interested in coding and software development or cybersecurity as a post-military career pursuit and/or make your big idea a reality; 
* Actively engaged in our community on Slack; 
* Active contributor in our open source projects on GitHub; 
* Follower and participant in our social media profiles, ex. Twitter & Facebook; 
* Willing to be interviewed pre-conference for our Medium to share your story; 
* Willing to document your experience and lessons learned in Medium on the conference within two weeks.

Unfortunately, at this time we are unable to cover travel/lodging. However, our development team is actively pursuing opportunities to fund this. 

For questions about conference scholarships please reach out to @scholarships-team (in Slack) or staff@operationcode.org.
