# Chapter
The following content is a guideline for chapter management.

## Chapter Leaders

An Operation Code *Chapter Leader* organizes meetups and events at the local level, and establishes relationships with local companies, educational institutions, and other organizations, in order to help build the community and [support the mission.](https://github.com/OperationCode/board/blob/master/proposals/STRATEGIC-POLICY.md)

### Who is a Chapter Leader?

* Represents the Operation Code [values.](https://github.com/OperationCode/board/blob/master/proposals/STRATEGIC-POLICY.md)
* Dedicated, reliable and has consistently displayed participation in the community.
* Understands the community dynamics and encourages members to have a voice. Empowers people.
* Organized, and able to stay on top of their multiple responsibilities, such as managing events and recruiting new members.
* Passionate communicators that have a strong desire to connect with like-minded people.
* Able to explain basic programming concepts to chapter members if necessary, as new chapter members may range from being senior software developers, to having little or no experience with software development. 

### Responsibilities
* Enforce the [Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/OperationCode/community/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
* Host events, including trainings, talks, hack nights, etc.
* Build partnerships in the local community.
* Raise funds and in-kind donations in [support of the mission.](https://github.com/OperationCode/board/blob/master/proposals/STRATEGIC-POLICY.md)
* Build and integrate the infrastructure necessary to sustain the chapter.
* Reach out to potential new members, receiving and integrating them to the team.
* Advocate for and promote the organization in the local community.

### Attendance
*Chapter Leaders* are expected to be present for all meetups in which their chapter is active. If they cannot attend a meeting, they should notify a *Community Manager* on Slack prior to the event so arrangements can be made.

### Availability
If a chapter project extends past the first meeting, we encourage the chapter leader to maintain contact with his team. *Chapter Leaders* can make themselves available to answer questions outside of the meetup via Slack. This maintains a level of consistency with members of the chapter.  It is also recommended that a team DM is created by the chapter leader to share any pertinent information with their team.

Introduction resources will also be available to new members to consume when away from the meeting.

## Running an Event
*Chapter Leaders* should have a clear game plan to execute the perfect event. Below are a few items a *Chapter Leader* should think through when planning an event.

### Before the Event
* Determine the Event Type: Events may include a talk, presentation, lesson, workshop or be social which many *Chapter Leaders* choose to make their first event to break the ice.
* Organize the Logistics: Ironing out the details includes finding the right venue, time, mix of speakers, coordinating catering, and preparing relevant materials.
* Create a Buzz: After creating a Meetup event, *Chapter Leaders* have the option to announce the Meetup immediately or wait to 'Announce later.' *Chapter Leaders* should also reach out to their community via social media with a hashtag, local marketing, or word of mouth and link to the Meetup event page to RSVP.

### During the Event
* Stand Out: *Chapter Leaders* should get to the event early to set up and make themselves noticeable. Members oftenÂ feel nervous showing up to their first Meetup, so *Chapter Leaders* should greet them at the door, put up signs, and wear a name tag to make members feel welcome.
* Work the Room: *Chapter Leaders* are responsible for making sure Meetup events are emotionally compelling and resonate with attendees. Having fun and creating positive memories will both build and deepen brand loyalty. To distribute the workload, you may consider assigning various responsibilities to chapter members such as: Attendance Taker, Photographer, Host, Presenter, or Social Media Manager.

### After the Event
* Confirm Attendance: *Chapter Leaders* should reconcile the actual headcount vs. RSVPs to accurately capture the success of the event.
* Thank the Attendees: *Chapter Leaders* should email those members that attended and thank them for coming. Members appreciate knowing that you care and taking a moment to thank those who came reminds them they're important to you and the community.
* Send an Event Recap: Sharing the event highlights, pictures, and relevant resources does a couple of things: for one, it's nice to have a record of how the event went for those members who were able to go. But moreover, sending out a recap of how things went shows people who didn't come what they're missing. A good recap might just be the nudge those members need to come out to the next Meetup!
* Capture Event Feedback: Reaching out to members for feedback allows *Chapter Leaders* to understand what their community expects and further engage them so that future events are even more successful. *Chapter Leaders* can email members, create a message board or ask folks for their feedback and suggestions at the end of the event in person. Members can also leave feedback directly on the Meetup event page.
* Schedule the Next Meetup: In order to encourage engagement after a successful event, *Chapter Leaders* should make sure they have their next Meetup already scheduled so organizations can build off this momentum and great experience attendees had!
