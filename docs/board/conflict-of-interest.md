# CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY AND AGREEMENT
 
## ARTICLE I
### PURPOSES
It is important Operation Code’s directors, officers, and staff to be aware that both real and apparent conflicts of interest or dualities of interest sometimes occur in the course of conducting the affairs of the corporation and that the appearance of conflict can be troublesome even if there is in fact no conflict whatsoever.  Conflicts occur because the many persons associated with the corporation should be expected to have, and do in fact generally have multiple interests and affiliations and various positions of responsibility within the community.  In these situations a person will sometimes owe identical duties of loyalty to two or more corporations.  The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the corporation’s tax-exempt interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.  The policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.
Conflicts are undesirable because they potentially or eventually place the interests of others ahead of the corporation’s obligations to its charitable purposes and to the public interest.  Conflicts are also undesirable because they often reflect adversely upon the person involved and upon the institutions with which they are affiliated, regardless of the actual facts or motivations of the parties. However, the long-range best interests of the corporation do not require the termination of all association with persons who may have real or apparent conflicts that are harmless to all individuals or entities involved.
Each member of the board of directors and the staff of the corporation has a duty of loyalty to the corporation.  The duty of loyalty generally requires a director or staff member to prefer the interests of the corporation over the director’s/staff’s interest or the interests of others.  In addition, directors and staff of the corporation shall avoid acts of self-dealing which may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the corporation or cause there to arise any sanction or penalty by a governmental authority.
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
 
## ARTICLE II
### DEFINITIONS
 
#### 2.1   Interested Person 
Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.
#### 2.2   Financial Interest 
A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, thorough business, investment, or family:
(a)  An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement,
(b)  A compensation arrangement with the corporation or with any entity or individual with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or
(c)  A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.  A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest.  Under Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

 
## ARTICLE III
### PROCEDURES
#### 3.1   Duty to Disclose

(b)  The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
(c)   After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
(d)  If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the corporation’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
 
#### 3.4  Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
(a)  If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
(b)  If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
