Purpose

As a matter of ethics and law, Operation Code is committed to protecting the confidential information it collects in the course of operations, and expects all associated with Operation Code to adhere to this policy.This is a basic component of business ethics. 

Policy

Maintaining Confidentiality. Operation Code expects its board members, volunteers, members and staff to maintain confidentiality and to respect a) the privacy of our volunteers, members and donors; and b) to protect Operation Code’s business data.

All financial and personal information concerning members, former members, staff, volunteers and donors, as well as Operation Code’s business operations, is considered to be confidential. 

No information reasonably expected to be private may be released without appropriate authorization from Operation Code senior managers and/or (if relevant) the individual or organizations involved. 

Definition. “Confidential” means that you are free to talk about Operation Code and about your program and your position, but that you are not permitted to disclose individual personal information or discuss such information in ways that will make their identity known; nor are you permitted to reveal Operation Code’s mission-critical data.
	
	This definition applies to conversations and communications outside of Operation Code. 
It also applies to Operation Code’s internal operations. E.g., private donor information, volunteer and staff records and organization trade secrets may not be shared with the general membership. Furthermore, such information should not be shared with others unless there is a specific reason to do so, as with the following illustrative examples:
A donor profile is reviewed during a donor strategy meeting involving a board member, fundraising staff and the CEO. Afterwards, copies of the donor profile are collected and destroyed, except for the copy associated with the donor’s CRM record.
A committee is reviewing award amounts for new scholarships. Committee members have signed the confidentiality policy, and never say a word to anyone about who was awarded what amount--and document copies are collected and destroyed. Award history and other personal information is accessible only to staff with direct responsibility for the program.
A mentor and mentee carry out private conversations using Operation Code hosted technology. These conversations remain private unless both parties agree to share. 
The CEO’s performance review is conducted by the Board. Written review material is reviewed by the Board, and afterwards destroyed, although copies are kept by the Chair and in organization files.

Individual Responsibility. Board members, volunteers and employees are cautioned to demonstrate professionalism, good judgment, and care to avoid unauthorized or inadvertent disclosures of confidential information and should, for example, refrain from leaving confidential information contained in documents or on computer screens in plain view. 

Upon separation of employment and at the end of a volunteer’s or board member’s term, he or she shall return, all documents, papers, and other materials, that may contain confidential information. 

Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action. This policy is intended to protect you as well as Operation Code because in extreme cases, violations of this policy also may result in personal liability.

Exceptions. This policy is not intended to prevent disclosure where disclosure is required by law. 

Procedures

On an annual basis, all board members, key volunteers associated with board committees, paid and unpaid staff, and chapter volunteers shall adhere are required to:
Review this policy.
Certify their commitment to adhering to the policy.
