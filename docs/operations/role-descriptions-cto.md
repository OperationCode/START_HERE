## Role of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

The Chief Technology Officer guides the technical evolution of Operation Code.  Our technical projects are self-sustaining open source projects - including front end projects (React), backend projects (Rails), and infrastructure projects (Docker and Kubernetes).  These projects are a key part of running the main operationcode.org site as well as managing the API connections between all our services - including Slack, Sendgrid, and more.  

Open Source projects at Operation Code are more than technical products - they are also teaching tools.  We are dedicated to using the most current technologies - through working on our open source projects, our community members learn the skills and build portfolios that will land them in-demand jobs in the technical marketplace.  

## Duties of the CTO

* Guiding governance of our open source projects through groups of core maintainers
* Providing technical leadership - driving the adoption of new technologies as appropriate and useful and within the scope of Operation Codeâ€™s mission
* Ensuring that all open source interactions are community driven with the goal of making the experience of every contributor - new or experienced - a delight
* Facilitating discussions, bringing opposing opinions to a consensus on the technologies that Operation Code runs
* Owning the infrastructure our projects run on - maintaining relationships with AWS and any other infrastructure services we use
* Scoping out work on new features, bug fixes, etc. - and assisting others in learning how to scope out issues into tasks a new contributor could easily get started with
* Guiding the forward evolution of our tools and technologies - making sure we are using the best to fulfill our mission
* Ensuring the security of our open source projects - especially of user data
* Leading by example by providing a positive example in terms of technical practices, leadership, and communication
* Growing technical leaders through delegating some members as technical leads to own a part of the stack to scale effectively while creating a technical team whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts
