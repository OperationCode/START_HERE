# Strategic Plan 2017-2021

## Our Vision
Operation Code is the leading veteran’s social impact organization, establishing connections between the military community and the civilian sector for software development opportunities.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to help the military community learn software development, enter the tech industry, and code the future! Through teaching veterans, transitioning servicemembers, and their families to code with open source projects, we'll be able to help fill our economy's technical talent shortage with our nation's finest.

## Our Core Values and Pillars 

* *Integrity.* We hold ourselves accountable for obtaining results that fulfill our Mission and work towards our Vision. As leaders, we are responsible for what we do or fail to do.  We act consistently with Operation Code's mission, being honest in what we do and say, and accept responsibility for our collective and individual actions.

* *Clear and Transparent.* By being transparent in everything Operation Code does, from our open source code base to our financial operations, our community can trust that we will do our best with the resources we are given. In the words of the US Army Signal Corps, we get the message through. We ensure that we are clear and concise in how we communicate, in support of our operations. We are considerate of the sender and the receiver, and communicate in the manner that best suits the needs of the mission and the vision.

* *Curiosity and Agility.* Innovation is central to our mindset. We maintain an attitude of continuous improvement and we constantly look for new and better ways to serve our community - we owe them nothing less. We run fast and we run lean. When our operating environment changes, and new challenges emerge, we are ready to respond. We communicate as early and as often as possible, and default to overcommunication in all of our interactions. 

* *Responsibility to the Community.* We exist to meet the needs of the military community. We will humbly remember that their service was of the highest order and that Operation Code works for them. When it comes to the welfare and well-being of our community, We look out for the people to our left and right, and always keep a hand free to help. We listen to our community and our people to ensure we are working towards the mission and the vision.

## Who We Serve
Past and present Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard service members, disabled veterans, and military spouses are welcome to apply to any of our programs. Through our online community, we work with 2000+ members around the world.

## Our Goals 2017-2021
* Develop our tech infrastructure to become a central hub of interaction for the military software development community.
* Expand the size and knowledge base of the Operation Code community by focusing on military installations and transition programs.
* Increase awareness of software development opportunities within the military community.
* Strengthen the relationship between the military community and tech industry.

## Background and Context
Active, transitioning military servicemembers’, Guard & Reserve troops and military spouses are not given the fullest opportunity to learn about software development as a post-military career path option. Operation Code’s Strategic Plan is designed to provide information, resources, and mentors to those military service members interested in becoming coders. The Operation Code Policy Committee and the Board of Directors developed this strategy with the goal that Operation Code would play a central role in the collaboration of the U.S. Government, specifically the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and coding schools around the world to support transitioning servicemembers’ career goals.

The 2017-2021 Strategic Plan addresses the improvement of the interface platform through which available information on resources is presented and mentorship takes place.  It also addresses the growth of the Operation Code community, giving annual goals and requirements for the scaling of resources.  While elements of the plan address specific bills, legislation, and elements of the economy, the overall plan is designed to ensure that the Operation Code community is able to grow with market demand.

### Our Programs & Services
Operation Code’s core programs and services are:

* Code Schools.  Operation Code assists members with finding the appropriate code schools to meet their aspirational programming needs.  Code schools are accelerated learning programs designed to prepare members for careers in software development.

* Scholarship Programs.  Operation Code partners with code schools and industry leaders to open opportunities to our members.  These scholarship programs make learning to develop software affordable and accessible to our members.

* Software Mentorship.  Through its mentorship program, Operation Code members connect with professional software developers for lifelong learning and understanding.  Paired online in our peer-to-peer learning environment, members can select any programming language/stack of their choice.  

* Employer Services.  Our military veterans proudly served their country and are now ready for their next assignment.  U.S. military service members bring an unique and valuable set of soft skills to the civilian workforce, especially to technology teams.  They can provide a significant talent advantage to innovative companies seeking to excel while diversifying their workforce.  Operation Code mentors and resources provide assistance to servicemembers in their pursuits to become professional software engineers.  In turn, Operation Code also assists businesses link with potential employees that can fulfill their software solution needs.  Operation Code created the Military Veterans Technical Talent Pipeline for the express purpose of expediting the military veterans technical talent pipeline to American companies.

* Web Application Development.  Operation Code’s Deploy program is a group of military veterans passionate about continuing to serve through quality web craftsmanship.  As a distributed team of full-stack web developers building complex web applications for the world wide web the Deploy team leverages the internet, open source software and modern tools in order to develop web applications that will help employ veterans, drive earned revenue to the nonprofit, and build organizational capacity.

## Our Goals

### Goal 1: Develop our tech infrastructure, to become a central hub of interaction for the military software development community.

Operation Code currently uses several platforms to pass information among its members. Most routinely, Slack is used as the central hub of information with Google Drive used as a repository for file sharing.  There is an opportunity for the members of Operation Code to turn the organization’s website into a more cohesive platform for operations, as the OperationCode.org website was created through open source sharing.  

Strategies:
* Use the OperationCode.org website as a symbol of the capabilities of a team of veteran coders.  Use the knowledge and skills of the members to design, build, test, and execute an open source website that can be used as the central processing point for all Operation Code activities.

### Goal 2: Increase the number of Code Schools approved by the VA to accept Post-9/11 GI Bill and vocational rehab funding.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) maintains the list of approved schools accepted for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Operation Code will work with code schools, state approving agencies, and the VA in order to increase the number of schools available to veterans and service members.

Strategies:
* Identify coding schools in each of the fifty states and in each of the U.S. territories.
* Evaluate the instruction and training provided to ensure that it meets criteria and standards laid out by the VA. Provide guidance to our community on schools that will result in career outcomes.
* Work with coding schools, state approving agencies and the VA to ensure completeness of the acceptance process.

### Goal 3: Increase the size and knowledge base of the Operation Code Community.

There are currently 900 members in the Operation Code community.  The groundwork should be laid out to increase this number by at least 40% annually in order to grow the community.  Current Operation Code members should be prepared to become the mentors of the incoming classes.  This will require constant personal growth as well as community growth.

Strategies:
* Develop within the OperationCode.org platform a way of tracking skills and training.  Allow new members to seek out mentors with the specific coding skills that they wish to master.
* Create a feedback loop within the community.  Identify those members who found employment in software development and determine how best to leverage their experience, their positions, and their knowledge of the field.
* Identify the skills and coding languages sought by potential employers.  Connect members with the coding schools that will give them the knowledge base they need in those specific areas in order to become competitive in the market.

### Goal 4: Increase awareness of software development opportunities within the military community.

Operation Code should be available to all transitioning military at the point that they determine that the military is no longer in their future career path.  This requires Operation Code to have a presence, physical and virtual, at military installations in order to assist with the services’ Transition Assistance Programs (TAP).

Strategies:
* Register Operation Code to have tables at TAP events. Train TAP advisors on the opportunities that Operation Code provides to transitioning service members.
* Coordinate with coding schools located near military installations to help transitioning servicemembers understand training requirements, costs, and career opportunities.

### Goal 5: Strengthen the relationship between the military community and the tech industry.

Operation Code will partner with corporate and non-corporate entities to identify programs and legislation that will help build the relationship between the military and the tech industry.  Operation Code will be the leader in guiding transitioning servicemembers into appropriate training schools and into the software development industry.

Strategies:
* Identify organizations with an interest in supporting the military community, and find ways to partner with them for brand promotion. Build a larger community by proactively reaching out to other VSOs and military groups on college campuses to find new members and ambassadors to help spread the word.
* Find organizations looking to hire and train military service members. Work with the DoD and the VA, to introduce transitioning service members with these corporate entities. Follow up with the corporate entities to determine the success rate of servicemembers in the industry.
* Gather data to confirm the hypothesis that the military community brings a performance advantage to the workforce. Create analytics and visualization of this data as a web-based product.
